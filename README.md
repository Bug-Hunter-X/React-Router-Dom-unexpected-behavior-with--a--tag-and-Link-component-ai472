This repository demonstrates an uncommon bug in React Router Dom v6.  When both <a> tags and Link components from react-router-dom are used in the same component to navigate, only the Link component triggers navigation, even if the <a> tag has a valid href attribute. This is unexpected behavior as <a> tags typically work as expected for navigation outside of React Router context. The bug is reproduced with the provided code example. The solution replaces the <a> tag with a Link component for consistent behavior.
